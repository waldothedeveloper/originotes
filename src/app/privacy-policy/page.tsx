              10. Controls For Do-Not-Track Features
            </h2>

            <p>
              Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
              applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you
              can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
              about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At
              this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
              implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
              currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
              that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
              online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must
              follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a
              revised version of this Privacy Notice.
            </p>

            <p>
              California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web
              browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or
              legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not
              respond to them at this time.
