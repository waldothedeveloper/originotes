# Some ideas I've gotten from the internet from business owners mouths

- For example, I need a way for my clients to fill out one loan application, save that info, and have a bot fill out four more applications using the same info. That alone would save me months of paid employee labor, spent manually filling out multiple applications.

From what I've searched, this type of service doesn't even exist. It's silly, because just this one model alone could easily be offered to real estate agents, car dealerships, or any retail or high-ticket stores that usually have multiple financing applications for their products. But there's nothing out there for that. I personally know some business owners who would pay a lot for this solution.

- Customers don't care about the tech, many business owners are fed up with the AI slop. They care if you can either increase their income or reduce their costs.
